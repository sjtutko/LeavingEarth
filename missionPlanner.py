--------------------------missionPlanner.py--------------------------
This module contains methods for basic mission planning algorithms
for the game Leaving Earth (by the Lumenaris Group) and the expansion 
packs: Outer Planets and Stations.
This module can be run on its own for basic mission planning or as
called by leavingEarth.py for higher level simulation.
